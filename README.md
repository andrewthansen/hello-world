Hello everyone!
My name is Andrew. I have been attending school for a Computer Programming degree for just short of a year now. 
I have been working a lot in Java and HTML/CSS. I have had some work with Javascript, XML, PHP and SQL. I have also
started working on learning Python. In the future I plan on also learning C++ and C#, as well as any other languages
that anyone would recommend learning. I enjoy learning and programming is a passion of mine. When I am finished with 
my schooling I hope to get into the software developement field.
